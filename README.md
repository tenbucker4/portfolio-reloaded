My second iteration of my personal portfolio, this time built in React. I wanted to make a cleaner design than my previous version. Some of the features in React (useRef, useState) make it super straightforward to implement certain features (darkmode/lightmode, page scrolling, etc.). The result is a fully responsive, professional-looking page that I'm proud to share.
